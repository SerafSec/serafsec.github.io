# Who We Are

We are a team of experienced cybersecurity professionals with more than 25 
years of combined experience in the industry. We have worked in a variety 
of roles such as network administration, system administration, DevOps, 
security engineering, project management, research and development, business
development, and more. Verticals we have worked in include healthcare and
telemedicine, telecommunications, finance, blockchain, cloud hosting, and 
sports. We have worked in both small businesses as well as Fortune 500 and
Global 50 companies. We have experience creating and securely operating 
traditional services and modern cloud native services with thousands of users,
while defining and managing compliance, regulatory, and security requirements.

Our research has been focused on developing distributed end user security and
privacy tools. We believe the tools exist to keep individuals and small 
businesses safe from cybercrime if applied correctly and intelligently.

# What We Do

We perform security assessments for small businesses and individuals and come 
up with plans to cooperatively improve security posture.

We work to understand your unique needs, risks, and constraints, to come up
with an appropriate and feasible security roadmap.

We don't just create a report and drop it in your inbox, we work together with
you to implement any necessary changes we discover.

We hope you never need to call us again! We're not interested in leaving you 
with infrastructure and documentation you don't understand. We want you to
be able to manage your security after we're gone.
