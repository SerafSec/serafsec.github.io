# Who You Are

You are a small business owner or manager who is concerned about ransomware,
phishing, hackers, and other digital threats. You're not sure where to begin, 
and you really just want to get back to what you to best: helping your 
customers. Perhaps you've recently been hacked, or you've just seen
a peer severely impacted by cybercriminals. 

You and your business have unique needs, risks, and constraints. 
You need an intelligent security assessment and a feasible security plan so you
can ensure that your customers, your employees, and your business are protected.

# Who We Are

We are a team of cybersecurity professionals with more than 25 
years of combined experience in the industry. We have worked in a variety 
of roles such as network administration, system administration, DevOps, 
security engineering, project management, research and development, business
development, and more. Verticals we have worked in include healthcare and
telemedicine, telecommunications, finance, blockchain, cloud hosting, and 
sports. We have worked in both small businesses as well as Fortune 500 and
Global 50 companies. We have experience creating and securely operating 
traditional services and modern cloud native services with thousands of users,
while defining and managing compliance, regulatory, and security requirements.

Our research has been focused on developing distributed end user security and
privacy tools. We believe the tools exist to keep individuals and small 
businesses safe from cybercrime if applied correctly and intelligently.

# What We Do

We perform security assessments for small businesses and individuals and come 
up with plans to cooperatively improve security posture, without a Fortune 500
budget.

We don't just create a report and drop it in your inbox, we work together
with you to implement any necessary changes we discover. We're not interested
in leaving you with infrastructure and documentation you don't understand. We
want you to be able to manage your security after we're gone.
